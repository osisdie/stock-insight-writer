As of late January 2026, ServiceNow (#[NOW](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NOW:NYSE)) trades around **$128-129** (up ~2.6% on Jan 22, but down significantly from 2025 highs above $200), reflecting broader software sector pressures and acquisition concerns (e.g., $7.75B Armis deal). However, the **breaking news of a multi-year partnership with OpenAI** — integrating advanced AI models into ServiceNow’s (#[NOW](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NOW:NYSE)) enterprise platform for agentic, multimodal workflows in IT, customer service, and operations — injects significant long-term potential, positioning [NOW](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NOW:NYSE) as a key player in AI-driven enterprise transformation.

This deal allows ServiceNow to embed OpenAI’s cutting-edge capabilities (e.g., voice agents, computer-use models) without building from scratch, enhancing competitiveness against rivals like Salesforce, SAP, and Workday. COO Brad Lightcap highlighted enterprise interest in AI that acts like a “teammate,” signaling deeper adoption in core workflows.

Analyst sentiment remains constructive: Despite some downward adjustments (e.g., Citi from $250.6 to $235, BMO from $230 to $175, Mizuho to $190, Oppenheimer to $175), all “Buy” ratings with targets **175-235** imply **36-83% upside** from current lows. Guggenheim’s upgrade and positive SA analyses (e.g., “AI Adoption Supports 20%+ Growth,” “Rare Entry Opportunity”) underscore resilience amid AI tailwinds.

Here is a representative **1-year stock price trend chart** for [NOW](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NOW:NYSE) (from early 2025 to January 2026), showing the pullback from peaks amid market rotations but potential stabilization with AI catalysts:

While near-term volatility persists (e.g., Q4 earnings Feb 2026), the OpenAI tie-up adds meaningful AI firepower, suggesting undervaluation at these levels for patient investors eyeing structural growth.
