As of late January 2026, Apple (#[AAPL](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ)) shares trade around **$250** (up ~4.7% in recent sessions), extending a solid YTD gain amid resilient iPhone demand and AI anticipation. The stock’s steady climb looks set for further acceleration, fueled by a groundbreaking collaboration with Google Gemini to enhance Siri with advanced AI capabilities and a massive 2026 product pipeline of up to 26 new releases.

Key highlights from recent developments:

*   **Gemini AI Integration for Siri**: Apple’s partnership with Google (#[GOOGL](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GOOGL:NASDAQ)) integrates Gemini models into Apple Intelligence, powering a revamped Siri with multimodal, agentic features. This could debut as early as iOS 26.4 in February 2026, enabling more intuitive, context-aware interactions — a critical upgrade to compete in the AI era and drive ecosystem stickiness.
    
*   **2026 Product Explosion**: Leaks point to an unprecedented rollout, including the first foldable iPhone (potentially iPhone Fold/Ultra with titanium build and crease-free display), affordable A-series MacBook, M5-chip upgrades across Mac/iPad lines, AI-enhanced AirPods Pro 3 with cameras, OLED iPad mini, next-gen Apple Watch, HomePod Touch with 7-inch screen, and even Apple Glasses prototypes. This diverse slate targets affordability, AI, and new categories, positioning Apple for multi-quarter growth.
    

Seeking Alpha analyses reflect optimism, with titles like “Apple’s AI Push: A Game-Changer” and strong fundamentals (e.g., services revenue growth, buybacks) supporting the narrative.
