The infographic underscores HDD’s enduring role in nearline and cold storage tiers, where cost-per-GB advantages and advancements like HAMR (Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording) continue to support capacity scaling. Market projections indicate steady growth, with enterprise nearline HDDs remaining the dominant segment amid surging exabyte-level demand.

Seagate Technology (#[STX](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/STX:NASDAQ)), the industry leader, has seen strong performance reflecting this trend. In Q4 2025, the stock rose from approximately **$200** to **$300+** (peaking near $332), capturing the market’s recognition of accelerating storage needs driven by AI and cloud infrastructure.

For reference, a representative chart illustrating this upward trajectory in 2025:

Compared to SSDs, which excel in performance metrics, HDDs maintain superiority in large-scale, archival, and cost-sensitive deployments. As data creation outpaces new storage capacity additions, HDDs are positioned for continued relevance in tiered storage architectures over the coming years.

Overall, the HDD sector is transitioning from cyclical to more structural growth, making it a compelling area for long-term observation in the storage ecosystem.
