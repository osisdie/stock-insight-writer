As of mid-January 2026, PayPal (#[PYPL](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PYPL:NASDAQ)) trades around **$57** (near recent lows after a challenging 2025), down ~35% over the past year. However, the risk/reward profile looks increasingly attractive, with the stock appearing undervalued relative to its long-term growth prospects.

Raymond James recently maintained a “Market Perform” rating ahead of the Q4 earnings (Feb 11, 2026), noting that the current valuation (~10x FY2026 P/E, 9x adjusted FY2027 EPS, PEG ratio of 0.59, and a perfect Piotroski score of 9) already prices in near-term headwinds like branded TPV slowdown and market share pressures. The low PEG signals the market may be overly discounting PayPal’s ability to rebound and capture upside from emerging trends.

Key recent developments reinforce this optimism:

*   **Deep integration into AI-driven commerce**: PayPal (#[PYPL](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PYPL:NASDAQ)) is supporting Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), positioning it as a trusted payment option in AI Mode on Google Search and the Gemini app. This enables seamless, agentic checkouts without leaving the interface — a major step toward the next era of open, interoperable AI shopping (announced Jan 11, 2026).
    
*   **Strategic partnerships expanding reach**: Collaborations with Paychex (enabling employees to access pay up to 2 days early via Direct Deposit), Mastercard (boosting transaction volume through debit integration), and others like Microsoft Copilot Checkout highlight PayPal’s push into payroll, embedded finance, and AI-enhanced payments.
    

These moves position PayPal (#[PYPL](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PYPL:NASDAQ)) to benefit from the accelerating shift toward AI-powered, frictionless commerce, where its massive network (430M+ consumer accounts, millions of merchants) provides a durable moat.

Here is a representative **1-year stock price trend chart** for [PYPL](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PYPL:NASDAQ) (from Jan 2025 to Jan 2026), showing the decline from mid-80s highs through volatility, bottoming near the low-50s, and recent stabilization/resilience amid these positive catalysts:

While macro concerns and competition persist, the combination of depressed valuation, strong fundamentals, and AI/commerce tailwinds makes [PYPL](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PYPL:NASDAQ) a compelling watch for 2026 recovery. Consensus analyst targets remain higher (~$75–$90 range in recent updates), suggesting meaningful upside if execution continues.
