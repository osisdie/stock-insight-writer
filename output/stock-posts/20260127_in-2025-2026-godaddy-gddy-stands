Early in 2025, the **[FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/)** highlighted significant cybersecurity deficiencies in GoDaddy’s operations dating back to 2018, including shortcomings in asset management, patching, risk assessment, MFA, logging, and monitoring. This led to multiple incidents between 2019 and 2022. In response, by late 2025 GoDaddy (#[GDDY](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GDDY:NYSE)) upgraded its **Agent Name Service (ANS)** with a new Marketplace and curated AI agents. This combines human-readable names with cryptographic identity verification to help small businesses and developers discover, verify, and manage trusted AI agents more securely and practically.

The AI boom has also accelerated demand for domain hosting and related services among startups, individual entrepreneurs, and AI-focused projects, leveraging GoDaddy’s established base of small business customers.

GoDaddy’s stock has declined substantially from highs near **$200** a year ago to around **$106** currently (approximately 48-50% drop), creating an attractive entry point. Analyst projections include revenue reaching approximately $5.9 billion by 2028 with continued growth in AI and SaaS offerings, while price targets average around $175 (implying meaningful upside). The current valuation reflects a more reasonable multiple following the pullback, especially given the company’s strategic pivot toward AI-enhanced security and identity solutions.

Overall, GoDaddy’s combination of regulatory response, AI innovation, and exposure to rising digital infrastructure demand positions it for potential recovery and structural growth in the coming years. This makes it a noteworthy long-term consideration in the storage-adjacent services ecosystem.
