After a brutal sell-off in late 2025 and early 2026, **UnitedHealth Group** (#[UNH](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/UNH:NYSE)) now trades around **$285-290**, down over 47% from its peaks. This pullback, driven by Medicare Advantage headwinds, cost pressures, and sector-wide concerns, creates a potential entry point for long-term holders.

Analysts have trimmed targets but remain constructive:

*   JPMorgan → $389 (overweight)

*   Truist → $370 (buy)

*   Wells Fargo → $370


Consensus sits around $375-390, implying 30-35%+ upside from current levels. These adjustments reflect near-term caution, not a breakdown in the core thesis.

At its foundation, [UNH](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/UNH:NYSE) operates in a defensive, essential industry—Americans need health coverage, period. The company has moved past prior leadership disruptions and continues to leverage its enormous trove of healthcare data with mature AI applications.

A prime example: UnitedHealthcare’s **Benefit Assist®** uses AI to automatically identify and distribute supplemental cash payments (e.g., for serious illnesses, accidents, hospital stays, or maternity leave), delivering nearly **4x more payments** than traditional plans—often proactively and with minimal paperwork. This is one of over 1,000 AI tools in production across the group, focused on making care simpler and more affordable.

In an environment where healthcare demand is structural and non-discretionary, [UNH](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/UNH:NYSE)’s scale, data moat, and responsible AI deployment position it well for eventual recovery and growth.
