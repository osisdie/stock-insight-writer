After years of post-pandemic normalization and steep declines (down ~79% from 2022 peaks through early 2025), Zoom Communications (#[ZM](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ZM:NASDAQ)) is showing clear signs of a structural turnaround. As of mid-January 2026, shares trade around **$80-81** (with recent resilience and upward momentum), positioning 2026 as the ideal year for Zoom to reclaim its spot as a leading AI-powered collaboration platform.

Here are the two key attached stock trends that highlight the shift:

1.  **Long-term (5-year) price % change** — massive drawdown from pandemic highs, but stabilizing in 2025-2026 with recent positive inflection:

Key catalysts driving this comeback:

*   **Agentic AI leadership**: At Zoomtopia 2025, Zoom (#[ZM](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ZM:NASDAQ)) unveiled **AI Companion 3.0**, evolving from passive assistance to proactive, action-oriented AI. Features include deeper conversational insights (synthesizing internal knowledge + external data), advanced note-taking across platforms (including third-party like Teams/Meet), automated task handling, and agentic retrieval for context-aware productivity. This positions Zoom Workplace as an “AI-first” platform beyond video — turning meetings into actionable intelligence.

*   **Strategic AI alliances**: [Zoom’s partnership and investment in Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/zoom-partnership-and-investment) (dating back but strengthened in the AI era) integrates frontier models like Claude to enhance reliability and steerability in enterprise AI. Combined with NVIDIA (#[NVDA](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVDA:NASDAQ)) collaborations for customized, high-performance AI services, Zoom is accelerating enterprise adoption in hybrid work, CX, and beyond.

*   **Strong fundamentals & execution**: Recent Q3 FY2026 results (reported Nov 2025) delivered revenue of ~$1.23B (up 4.4% YoY), EPS beat expectations, raised full-year guidance, and aggressive buybacks. Enterprise revenue growth (6%+), expanding margins (non-GAAP operating ~41%), and RPO acceleration signal sustained momentum. Analysts on Seeking Alpha highlight renewed growth, high margins, solid cash generation, and value opportunity (many “Strong Buy” views with targets implying meaningful upside).


Zoom (#[ZM](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ZM:NASDAQ)) is no longer just a “video meeting company” — it’s evolving into a comprehensive AI-powered work platform for human connection and productivity. With macro tailwinds in hybrid/RTO environments, AI adoption, and a depressed valuation relative to peers, **2026 looks primed for Zoom’s renaissance**.
